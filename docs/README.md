# 📚 WhiteRose - Clean & Hexagonal Architecture Migration Documentation

## 🎯 Overview

This documentation contains a complete guide to migrate the WhiteRose project from its current architecture to clean architecture and hexagonal architecture. The migration is designed to improve testability, maintainability, and extensibility of the project.

## 🏗️ Current vs. Proposed Architecture

### 📊 Current Architecture

- **High Coupling**: CLI commands directly coupled to implementations
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Business logic and infrastructure in the same code
- **Testing Difficulty**: External dependencies hard to mock
- **Limited Extensibility**: Adding features requires modification in multiple places

### 🎯 Proposed Architecture (Hexagonal/Clean)

- **Low Coupling**: Well-defined interfaces between layers
- **Clear Separation**: Domain, application, and infrastructure separated
- **High Testability**: Interfaces allow easy mock creation
- **Extensibility**: New adapters and use cases without modifying the core

## 🚀 Migration Benefits

### 1. **Testability** 🧪

- Isolated unit tests per layer
- Easy to create and maintain mocks
- Complete business code coverage

### 2. **Maintainability** 🔧

- Clearly defined responsibilities
- Cleaner and more readable code
- Localized changes per layer

### 3. **Extensibility** 📈

- New use cases without core impact
- Multiple adapters for different sources
- Support for different interfaces (CLI, API, GUI)

### 4. **Flexibility** 🔄

- Easy implementation swapping
- Technology-agnostic configuration
- Adaptation to different environments

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- Basic knowledge of Clean Architecture
- Familiarity with dependency injection patterns
- Understanding of SOLID principles

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. 📖 **Read the detailed comparison**: [architecture/current-vs-proposed.md](architecture/current-vs-proposed.md)
2. 🗺️ **Study the diagrams**: [architecture/hexagonal-diagram.md](architecture/hexagonal-diagram.md)
3. 📋 **Review the execution plan**: [migration/execution-plan.md](migration/execution-plan.md)
4. 🚀 **Start Phase 1**: [migration/phases/phase-1-domain.md](migration/phases/phase-1-domain.md)

## ❓ Questions and Support

This documentation was created to be self-sufficient, but if questions arise:

1. Consult the complete code examples in `code-examples/`
2. Review the flow diagrams in `architecture/`
3. Check the best practices guide in `how-to/best-practices.md`

## 📝 Contributing

When finding improvements or issues in the documentation:

1. Clearly document the problem or suggestion
2. Include examples when possible
3. Maintain consistency with the established pattern
